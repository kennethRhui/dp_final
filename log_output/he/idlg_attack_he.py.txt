HE PROTECTION EFFECTIVENESS SUMMARY
======================================================================
Total attacks attempted: 25
Successfully blocked attacks: 25
HE Protection Rate: 100.0%

HE PROTECTION QUALITY BREAKDOWN:
Excellent Protection (MSE > 0.3): 25/25 (100.0%)
Good Protection (0.1 ≤ MSE ≤ 0.3): 0/25 (0.0%)
Poor Protection (MSE < 0.1): 0/25 (0.0%)

OVERALL PROTECTION STATISTICS:
Average MSE: 0.482808 (higher = better protection)
Average Attack Time: 0.92s (time wasted by attackers)

FINAL CONCLUSION: Homomorphic Encryption provides EXCELLENT protection against iDLG attacks
RESULT: ✓ SUCCESS
